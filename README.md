- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Coranath
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in: Computer Science! Almost all facets of it! I realize that is a broad topic and I know that I wont be able to work in, or understand a lot of what is
   happening in the field but as of yet I'm not sure where I want my focus to be! So for now I am experiementing with multiple fields and areas within Computer Science!
