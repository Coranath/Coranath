- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Coranath
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in: Computer Science! Almost all facets of it! I realize that is a broad topic and I know that I wont be able to work in, or understand a lot of what is
   happening in the field but as of yet I'm not sure where I want my focus to be! So for now I am experiementing with multiple fields and areas within Computer Science! 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on getting my JNCIA as well as hoping to change positions! The job I have now is good but it doesn't offer me a lot of learning opportunities!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me:
   You can hit me up at @levimoo72295539 on Twitter! Sorry if that is a stupid looking username thing. I only JUST got on Twitter! I had been avoiding it but it seems to be a
   useful networking tool!
